🎲 Simulating Statistics

Randomness, Visualized.

Simulating Statistics is a collection of interactive browser-based experiments that turn probability, randomness, and statistical ideas into something you can see.

Every simulation is written using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no dependencies — making the math feel transparent and the code easy to explore.

This project lets you:

Flip coins and watch the Law of Large Numbers settle

Roll dice and see distributions morph toward a bell curve

Walk randomly and discover diffusion patterns

Switch doors in Monty Hall to beat your own intuition

Watch Markov Chains converge to their stationary state

Crawl along a line in Gambler’s Ruin and see absorbing states

And much more…

Each page is a self-contained mini-lab: tweak the settings, change the speed, increase the trials, or just let randomness run wild until order emerges.

Whether you’re a student, a teacher, or just someone who loves math magic,
this repo turns abstract theory into interactive intuition.
